Over the past two decades, the automotive industry has
aggressively researched ways to exploit modern computing
and electronic advances in the development of safety,
reliability, and entertainment technologies. Despite this,
automatic rain-sensing wiper systems are relatively uncommon
in modern vehicles for a number of reasons. They are often too
expensive, too unsightly, or too unreliable to be desired in new
automobiles. Many attempts have been made at constructing
an effective, reliable, and cheap rain detection and wiper
control system for vehicles speed and intermittent interval
automatically according to the amount of rain. To measure
the amount of water usually use optical sensor. In this type of
sensors uses the fact that the refraction angle and the amount
of reflection of the light are different when the 2 windshield
is wet. Even though optical sensors are used widely they have
some disadvantage. One of disadvantages is the sensitivity to
external light. Another problem is occurs when car drive at
night or gone through tunnel and even in underground parking.
For this many systems still activate the wiper when the car
comes out of tunnels or underground parking lot. Another
shortfall, maybe a major one is that the sensing area is a
relatively small portion of windshield. Hence the system
operates only with limited area. The wiper system may fail to
activate when there are some raindrops on the driverâ€™s line of
sight, but not on the sensing area.
