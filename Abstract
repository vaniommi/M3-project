Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. The previous system
used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this system is
proposed to solve these problems. The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic
wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with
the system. The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper. In spite of removing
water from windscreen, this system also will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a Peripheral Interface
Controller (PIC) 16F877A controller and water sensor. As the conclusion for the project, the results shows all the aim
objectives are successfully achieved. The wiper system was well functionally according the water condition from the outside of a
car. This project showed a contribution on the design of the automatic wiper system for the future research in this same field. It
is recommended that the system to have a study on the wiper material that been used to make a wiper because the driver at hot
and climate country are facing the problems regards to the wiper material.
